            soon they will die
            life is a broken a broken-winged bird
            who always will try but never will fly
            who never will fly
            and never get heard

            hold fast to your dreams
            for when dreams will go
            life is a barren field frozen with snow
            which never will feed any kind of hope
            any kind of hope
            no place to lie low

            hold fast to your dreams
            they wont come true
            and if you think your life is under control
            and you don't know how high to rise
            how high to rise
            until you fall

            hold fast to your dreams
            as strong as you can
            reality fights against you every day
            trying to break your hope apart
            your hope apart
            and leave you astray

            life after life
            and age after age
            timorous soul

            sun beaten path
            which way to take

            life after life
            and age after age
            when do we start to believe

            life after life
            and age after age
            name fame or love
            what to achieve</p>

            Want to be forgiven
            Waiting for the battle
            Aching for belief
            But your answer is wrong
            And my spirit is broken
            Like choirs in the winter
            Singing out of key
            I am silent
            Invisible to you
            While I count the days gone by
            I am silent
            Invisible to you
            While I shape the things to come
            I am silent
            Invisible to you
            While I count the days gone by
            I try so hard
            To fight for an illusion
            Holding my breath
            Biting my tongue
            I try to cope
            So give me a reason
            I'm waiting for help
            I'm trapped by my guilt
            Want to be forgotten
            Tired of the noise
            Aching for relief
            But your anger is gone
            And my silence is golden
            Like fires on the water
            Drifting out of reach</p>

            Beyond words, they say so many things to me
            A stranger here, reborn it seems
            Awaking wonders deep in me
            If nothing's ventured, nothing's gained
            So I must seize the day

            And fighting time, so hard I pray
            That this moment lasts forever
            And will the world stay standing still, at least for me
            Through my eyes, stare into me
            I bear my heart for all to see
            With my face turned to the sun, there ever standing still

            It wasn't you, it wasn't me, it wasn't anything
            It was a day so long awaited and a chance to be as me
            I let the wind run through my hands
            Before I turned to walk away
            In distant days, I long to sense it, all so clear

            And fighting time, so hard I pray
            That this moment lasts forever
            And will the world stay standing still, at least for me
            Through my eyes stare into me
            I bear my heart for all to see
            With my face turned to the sun, there ever standing still

            I had no faith before that time in any vow or deed
            Days followed days and years were meaningless
            Despite the wisdom of defeat
            I bore my heart for all to see, the wonders I'd seen

            Take some more to feel OK

            Take some more - to feel OK
            Take some more - carry the day

            On your marks and keep ahead
            With the aim to stay in the red
            Friend are cut out - it's your game
